This is The TEAM GENERATOR APP.

This is my first time app that i have built with Angular Framework.

Fisrt thing first, I built this app by watched Angular tutorials from Youtube and Google
and for references i utilize https://angular.io/ as my refences.

Flow of the APP:

Start --> User Interface --> Team Generator --> Input Name Member --> Add Member --> Show the name on screen--> input how many team that u want to generate --> Generate it --> the member will be divided to some team --> walaaa you have team now ! --> End
